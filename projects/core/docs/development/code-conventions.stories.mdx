# Code Conventions

In general, if possible, any code convention should be enforced by the build
system and not require explicit documentation. The following are conventions
not currently enforced by our build.

## Filenames

- Components should end with an `element` suffix.
  `packages/core/my-toggle/my-toggle.element.ts`.

- Stateless Utilities should be named appropriately in the `utils` directory.
  `packages/core/internal/utils/register.ts`.

- Stateful Utilities should be named with a `service` suffix in the `services`
  directory. `packages/core/internal/services/common-strings.service.ts`.

- Common Interfaces should be named with an `interface` suffix in the `interfaces`
  directory. `packages/core/internal/interfaces/types.interface.ts`.

- Common Enums should be named with an `enum` suffix in the `enums`
  directory. `packages/core/internal/enums/key-events.enum.ts`.

- Common Functions should have an appropriate file name with no prefix or suffix
  that describes the functionality.

## Naming and TypeScript Conventions

- Function Utilities should be named by their sole responsibility.
  `function myUtil() { }`

- Stateful Class Services should be suffixed with `Service`.
  `class MyUtilService { }`

- Private properties **not** be prefixed with a `_` but denoted with the `private` keyword.
  Long term when EcmaScript [private fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields)
  and [private methods](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-methods) land
  we will migrate to use the native syntax.

  There are two exceptions to this rule, and they're the only cases where we allow
  the use of an `_` prefix: A private property is hidden behind a getter
  (and maybe a setter) that has the same name.

  ```typescript
  private _open: boolean;
  get open(): boolean;
  set open(value: boolean);
  ```

- Public properties and methods should not need `public` keyword as that is
  the default behavior.

  ```typescript
  open = false;
  next() { ... }
  private name: string;
  ```

- Constants internal to Clarity are named following the `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
  convention.

- Enum values are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` because they are constant. For
  instance: `KeyboardKeys.ARROW_DOWN`.
