Signposts are a variation of popups/dropdowns. They are offered as a convenience to pre-configure a popup to have the
default options the signpost component in Clarity Angular (`@clr/angular`) did.

By default, signposts are both closable and configured to have an "angle" pointer.

As a public alias for an internal generic popup component, signposts have all the positioning and customization options
available to both popups and dropdowns.

## Installation

To use the signpost component import the component in your JavaScript.

```typescript
import '@cds/core/signpost/register.js';
```

```html
<cds-button popup="my-signpost" id="my-button" onclick="document.getElementById('my-signpost').hidden = false"
  >Open Signpost</cds-button
>
<cds-signpost anchor="my-button" id="my-signpost" orientation="right bottom">
  <div cds-layout="vertical gap:lg p:lg align:stretch">
    <h3 cds-first-focus cds-text="section" id="basic-signpost-title">Dropdown Title</h3>
    <p cds-text="body">Any content can be placed inside a generic signpost.</p>
    <p cds-text="body">Here we've placed a title and text in the signpost.</p>
    <p cds-text="body">Something should get immediate focus when the signpost opens. Here it is the title.</p>
  </div>
</cds-signpost>
```
