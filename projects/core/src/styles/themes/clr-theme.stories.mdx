# Clarity UI Theme

Clarity provides a theme the enables the `@clr/ui` package to consume the Clarity design tokens
and theme system. Once installed clr-ui applications will be able to use all standard Clarity
themes available today, in particular the color contrast adjustments in the light and dark themes.
If your application does not use `@clr/ui` this shim is not needed.

- [Stackblitz Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/clarity-with-clr-angular)

Follow the [Getting Started](.?path=/story/documentation-getting-started--page) directions for Clarity Core,
including loading the relevant CSS files and setting the `cds-theme` attribute on the body tag.
The shim will not be applied to `clr/ui` or `clr/angular` components without this attribute.

Import and load the CSS shim file last after `clr-ui` global CSS. This will ensure
that the shim can override the `clr-ui` values appropriately.

```scss
@import 'modern-normalize/modern-normalize.css';
@import '@cds/core/global.min.css';
@import '@cds/core/styles/theme.dark.min.css'; // to allow dark mode with cds-theme="dark"
@import '@cds/city/css/bundles/default.css';
@import '@cds/core/styles/shim.clr-ui.min.css'; // the shim file
@import '@clr/ui/clr-ui.min.css'; // clr-ui CSS
```

## Dark Mode

Core's dark mode should replace the clr/ui dark mode. Remove any reference to the clr-ui dark mode file
from the source code, and toggle dark mode by changing the `cds-theme` attribute to "dark."
