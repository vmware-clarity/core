# Clarity UI Theme

Clarity provides a theme the enables the `@clr/ui` package to consume the Clarity design tokens
and theme system. Once installed clr-ui applications will be able to use all standard Clarity
themes available today. If your application does not use `@clr/ui` this theme is not needed.

- [Repository Demo](https://github.com/vmware-clarity/core/tree/beta/apps/shim-clr-ui)
- [Stackblitz Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/clarity-with-clr-angular)

```scss
// import into sass or css
@import '@cds/core/styles/shim.clr-ui.min.css';

// or import in html
<link href="/node_modules/@cds/core/styles/shim.clr-ui.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Import and load the CSS shim file last after `clr-ui` global CSS. This will ensure
that the shim can override the `clr-ui` values appropriately.
